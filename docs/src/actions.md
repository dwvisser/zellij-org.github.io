These are the actions that can be assigned to key sequences when [configuring keybindings](./keybindings.md).
Or that can be invoked by the `zellij action` command.

## `Quit`

## `MovePane: <Direction>`

## `SwitchToMode: <InputMode>`

Note that there's a "hidden" mode called `RenameTab` which can be used in order to trigger the renaming of a tab.

## `Resize: <Direction>`
Resize focused pane in the specified direction.
Direction should be one of `Left`, `Right`, `Up`, `Down`, `Increase`, or `Decrease`.

Example: `Resize: Down`

Switch focus to next pane to the right or below if on screen edge.

## `FocusPreviousPane`
Switch focus to next pane to the left or above if on screen edge.

## `SwitchFocus`
Switch focus to pane with the next ID (this is mostly left around for legacy support, `FocusNextPane` or `FocusPreviousPane` should be preferred).

## `MoveFocus: <Direction>`
Move focus to the pane with the greatest overlap with the current pane in the specified direction. 
Direction should be one of `Left`, `Right`, `Up` or `Down`.

eg. `MoveFocus: Left`

## `ScrollUp`

## `NewPane: <Direction>`
Open a new pane in the specified direction (relative to focus).
If no direction is specified, will try to use the biggest available space.
Direction should be one of `Left`, `Right`, `Up` or `Down`.
Specifying no direction should be done by introducing a space character (this is a bug and should be fixed).

eg. `NewPane: Left` or `NewPane: `

## `CloseFocus`
Close the focused pane.

## `NewTab: <TabLayout>`

  ],}
```
a slightly more expansive example:
