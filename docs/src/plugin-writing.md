# Developing a Plugin

Currently we have a complete guide for developing plugins in [Rust](./plugin-rust.md) and in [Zig](./plugin-zig.md). We plan to add more guides for other languages in the future. If you are feeling particularly brave, you can try to write plugins in another language today! The [Other Languages](./plugin-other.md) section will get you started.
